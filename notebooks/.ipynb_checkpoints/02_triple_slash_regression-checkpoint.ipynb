    "My goal is to determine which of **AVG**, **OBP**, and **SLG** carry more weight in terms of a batter's overall contribution to **run expectancy**. The independent, or predictor, variables will each be **AVG**, **OBP**, and **SLG**. The dependent, or response, variable will be **RE24**, the metric that tracks total net **run expectancy** for a player's plate appearances. I chose **RE24** for that reason, instead of **runs scored** or **RBI**. **Runs scored**, for the most part, don't occur during a batter's plate apperance, unless they hit a **home run**. **RBI** are situational. You can't collect or amass **RBI** unless your teammates are on in front of you. That's not within a player's control. The outcome of their individual plate appearance, however, is mostly within their control.\n",
